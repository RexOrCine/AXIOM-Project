# AXIOM-Project

Welcome to the world of apertus°

... and the home of FOSS, open hardware, community-driven, professional digital cinema and imaging tools.

Individual projects being worked on inside the community are quite complex and if you're unfamiliar then getting an initial overview can be difficult. Please accept these pointers to assist.

Absolutely all documentation related to development is made publically available, e.g. design files, BOMs, software source code, etc (for everything... including FPGA), and the project's <a href="https://wiki.apertus.org/index.php/Main_Page">Wiki</a> is deep and extensive.

... a professional digital cinema camera built around FOSS and open hardware licenses.

The first of its kind, and providing users with the ability to swap or upgrade sensors at any time, the community’s debut camera is the result of years of collaboration with the <a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> team. With powerful internal components, custom-built printed circuit boards and plugin modules, FPGAs and an onboard Linux operating system at your disposal, changing the entire operation of the camera to suit the needs of any project is now possible.

The general approach for designing the AXIOM Beta PCB stack was to give every board a clear, core purpose and not just pack as many things as possible onto each one. This way individual PCBs can be replaced without affecting the rest of the stack - for example, as the interfaces between the boards are predefined, a new image sensor can be installed simply by changing the Sensor Board PCB. Likewise, as individual printed circuit boards ultimately become more complex and offer richer features, the user can upgrade any of the camera's boards as and when they're ready to do so. 

Unlike with existing manufacturers, who typically use the shelf-life of a camera's individual components as a way to ensure that a customer purchases a whole new camera, this approach also enables users to perform minor repairs in the event that, for example, one of the PCBs needs to be replaced.
